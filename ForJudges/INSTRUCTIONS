For those finding difficulty in manually downloading the datasets I have mentioned,

Here are the steps to run my project locally on your computer (an alternate approach for GitHub)

Firstly, make sure you have Python installed on your computer

Step 1: Make an account on MEGA (https://mega.io/)
Step 2: Download MEGA from here https://mega.io/desktop#download
Step 3: Download my project from MEGA (available with the trained model and data) from here:  https://mega.nz/folder/6UdWUaCB#ElN7jV4YIYfVopGX1-P87g
Step 4: Open command prompt on your computer and locate this project folder

for example: If you have downloaded this project in like C:/Users/YourName/MedSafe, write the following command in the command prompt 
cd C:/Users/YourName/MedSafe

Step 5: Write the following commands, one by one, let each command finish doing its job
pip install pandas
pip install catboost
pip install gradio
pip install joblib
pip install os
pip install ast

Step 6: After installing every mentioned dependancies, then type

python gradioapp.py

It takes around 45 seconds for the localhost port to launch my site then a message comes which says something like 
Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860

Copy that URL (http://127.0.0.1:7860) and paste it in your browser to finally open and work with my site
